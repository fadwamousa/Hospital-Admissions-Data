# Hospital-Admissions-Data

The Dataset is about a patient wait list data from 2018 to 2021 and it largely contains three categories; Outpatient, Inpatient, and Day case

> Outpatient represents patients who receive hospital services and return home the same day.
> Inpatient means patients who stay in the hospital one or more nights for treatment. Inpatient care often deals with serious ailments that require continuous treatment and monitoring.
> Day case patient comes in the middle. They get hospital care and go home the same day, but they may need more time for recovery at the hospital.

The project goals are as followsâ€¦

1. Track the current status of the patient waiting list
2. Analyze the historical monthly trend of the waiting list for each category
3. Detailed specialty level & age profile analysis.

> Here is a list of questions to answer that will help gain more insights to understand the data and how this dashboard will guide achieve a specific business goal.

- [ ] What is the total wait line in the most recent month and how is different compared to the same month last year?
- [ ] What are the Top 10 Specialties that cause long wait lines, and what does the age profile look like for each specialty?
- [ ] What does the wait list trend look like for the last 3 years for each case type?
